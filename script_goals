what i want

1. dictionary showing how many times an application id is present in the csv_inf
2. a csv of all unique rows from the original
3. a csv of all rows removed (i.e. 5 of the same row when there was originally 6)
4. a csv of all rows that do not have an associated application id


why is this so hard for me?
